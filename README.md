# Data Structures Practice

This repository contains my personal collection of data structures problems and solutions that I practice to improve my programming skills. The code is organized by topic and includes implementations and examples in Java and Python.

## Directory Structure

- **ArrayList/**: ArrayList problems and custom implementations
- **Bit/**: Bit manipulation techniques and problems
- **fibonacci/**: Various Fibonacci sequence algorithms
- **Hashmap/**: HashMap usage and related problems
- **Hashset/**: HashSet usage and frequency/counting problems
- **Heap/**: Heap (PriorityQueue) problems, min-heap and max-heap examples
- **LinkedList/**: Linked list traversals and operations
- **math/**: Math-related algorithms (primes, sieve, etc.)
- **queue/**: Queue operations and traversal examples
- **stack/**: Stack operations and traversal examples
- **Swap/**: Different ways to swap variables in Java

## Contents

- Java and Python code for each topic
- Example input/output for most problems
- Practice scripts and notes

## Purpose

This repository is for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. It is not intended for production use, but as a reference and revision resource.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders for topics you want to study.
- Run the Java files using your favorite IDE or the command line.
- Python scripts can be run directly with Python 3.
